# Eco-Friendly Delivery: One Pedal at a Time

## Repository Summary
This repository contains the code for an eco-friendly delivery tracking application. The app calculates the CO2 savings when cyclists choose to deliver packages by bicycle instead of using gas-powered motorbikes. It provides visual feedback and food suggestions based on calories burned during the delivery process.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Tailwind CSS utility classes)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- SVG for icons

## External Datasets/Tools
- None. All data is contained within the application.

## Secrets and Environment Variables
This application does not require any secrets or environment variables to run.

## Local/Server Settings and Configurations
No specific settings or configurations are needed. The application runs entirely in the browser.

## Instructions for Running the Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/eco-friendly-delivery.git
   cd eco-friendly-delivery
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.

3. For development with live reloading, you can use a local server. If you have Node.js installed, you can use `http-server`:

   ```
   npm install -g http-server
   http-server
   ```

   Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
